Power System Check (If-Else)

Implement a Python program that checks if the total power in a system exceeds the safe limit. 
If it does, print "Power overload"; otherwise, print "Power within limit"."""
"""The safe power limit for single-phase and three-phase connections depends on various factors,
including voltage, current capacity, and regional regulations.
- Single-phase power: Typically used in homes and small businesses, 
single-phase connections in India operate at 230V with a frequency of 50Hz. 
The maximum load capacity can vary, but residential connections often handle up to 7.5 kW.
- Three-phase power: Used for industrial and commercial applications, three-phase connections in India operate
at 415V with a frequency of 50Hz. The maximum load capacity can go much higher, often exceeding 100 kW, 
depending on the infrastructure and transformer capacity.

For this example, let's assume a safe limit of 10 kW for single-phase connections and
